# VanillaPlus

VanillaPlus is a Sponge plugin for **Sponge API 7.2.0** *(Minecraft 1.12.2)* that adds a few extra commands that are designed to benefit the multiplayer vanilla experience. 

## Current Features
- Teleport Requesting
  - Players can request to teleport to other players. These requests can be accepted or declined, and are automatically declined after 1 minute.
  - These requests can be disabled on a per-player basis

## Planned Features
- Warp Commands *(things like ```/spawn /warp``` and ```/home```)*
- Player Vaults *(similar to how an ender chest might work, with the option of being expandable through permissions)*
- Playtime Tracker *(tell players how long someone has been online or offline for)*
